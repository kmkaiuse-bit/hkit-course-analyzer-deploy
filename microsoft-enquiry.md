Subject: Pricing Enquiry - Azure AI Foundry & Purview for Student Exemption Analysis

Dear Microsoft Team,

We're evaluating Azure AI Foundry and Microsoft Purview for an internal student course exemption analysis application.

Application Scope

- Purpose: AI-powered transcript analysis (PDF/OCR) to determine course exemptions based on prior learning
- Users: 5-10 internal academic staff
- Volume: ~1,000 analyses/year (peaks at 200+/month during intake periods)
- Documents: 1-7 page PDFs per analysis (including scanned documents)

Key Requirements

AI Efficiency (Azure AI Foundry):
- PDF/OCR processing and AI model integration for pattern matching
- Pay-as-you-go deployment for variable workloads

Security & Compliance (Microsoft Purview):
- Data governance for student records with role-based access
- Audit trails and data protection compliance

Questions

1. Estimated monthly/annual cost for this use case?
2. Pricing during peak periods (3-4x volume)?
3. Educational institution discounts available?
4. Recommended cost-effective architecture?

We're interested in how Azure AI Foundry and Purview deliver AI efficiency while maintaining enterprise-grade security for sensitive student data.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,

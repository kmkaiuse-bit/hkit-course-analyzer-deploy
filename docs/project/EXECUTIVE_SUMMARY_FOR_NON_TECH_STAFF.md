# Executive Summary: HKIT Course Analyzer Project
## For Non-Technical Staff & Management
### August - September 2025 Development Summary

---

## üéØ **What Was Built**

**HKIT Course Analyzer** is a web application that **automates student transcript analysis** for Advanced Standing applications. Instead of manually reviewing each transcript (which takes 2-3 hours), staff can now upload a PDF and get AI-powered exemption recommendations in **under 10 minutes**.

### **How It Works:**
1. **Upload**: Staff upload student transcripts (PDF, Excel, or CSV)
2. **AI Analysis**: Google AI reads the transcript and matches courses to HKIT exemptions  
3. **Review**: Staff review AI suggestions and make final decisions
4. **Export**: System generates analysis reports and study plans automatically

# üìã HKIT Course Analyzer - Demo Day Checklist

## üöÄ Pre-Demo Setup (30 minutes before)

### Technical Environment
- [ ] **Computer Setup**
  - [ ] Ensure Python is installed and working
  - [ ] Close unnecessary applications to free up memory

  - [ ] Clear browser cache and cookies
  - [ ] Close all unnecessary browser tabs
  - [ ] Bookmark: `http://localhost:8000/local/enhanced.html`
  - [ ] Test browser developer console (F12) - should be clear

- [ ] **Server Testing**
  - [ ] Test `start-local-enhanced.bat` - should open browser automatically
  - [ ] Verify URL opens correctly: `http://localhost:8000/local/enhanced.html`
  - [ ] Check "LOCAL ENHANCED MODE" badge appears
  - [ ] Verify all UI elements load properly

### API Configuration
- [ ] **Gemini API Key Ready**
  - [ ] Get API key from Google AI Studio
  - [ ] Test key works (can make a simple API call)
  - [ ] Have backup key available in case of issues
  - [ ] Document key for participants if needed

### Demo Materials
- [ ] **Sample Files**
  - [ ] Prepare 2-3 HKIT transcript PDFs with different programmes
  - [ ] Label files clearly (e.g., "Business_Student_Sample.pdf")
  - [ ] Test each PDF uploads successfully
  - [ ] Verify PDFs have good exemption match potential

- [ ] **Participant Materials**
  - [ ] Print `Demo_User_Feedback_Form.md` (one per participant)
  - [ ] Prepare pens/pencils for feedback forms
  - [ ] Bring name tags if participants don't know each other

## üé¨ Demo Script & Key Points

### Opening (2 minutes)
**"Welcome! Today we're showcasing a system designed to streamline your Advanced Standing application process. This isn't about replacing your expertise - it's about saving you time on repetitive tasks so you can focus on what matters most: helping students."**

- [ ] Set expectation: "We want YOUR honest feedback"
- [ ] Emphasize: "You're the experts - we need your input"
- [ ] Mention: "Everything runs locally - no internet after setup"

### Live Demo Flow
- [ ] **Step 1: Quick Setup (2 mins)**
  - Double-click `start-local-enhanced.bat`
  - Enter API key once
  - Point out "no technical skills needed"

- [ ] **Step 2: Core Workflow (10 mins)**
  - Student info entry (use real-sounding names)
  - Upload transcript PDF
  - Select appropriate programme
  - Show analysis in progress (explain what AI is doing)
  - Review results with participants

- [ ] **Step 3: Manual Control (5 mins)**
  - Enter edit mode
  - Change exemption decision with explanation
  - Add meaningful remark
  - Save changes

- [ ] **Step 4: Export Documents (5 mins)**
  - Generate Excel form (open to show format)
  - Create CSV for records
  - Show PDF format

### Key Messages to Reinforce
- [ ] **"You're still in control"** - System suggests, you decide
- [ ] **"Saves hours of work"** - Focus on impact to their day
- [ ] **"Consistent decisions"** - Same courses = same exemptions
- [ ] **"Official formats"** - Exports match current requirements

---

## üéØ Audience Engagement Strategy

### Questions to Ask Throughout Demo
- [ ] "Does this match how you currently assess exemptions?"
- [ ] "What would you change about this recommendation?"
- [ ] "Is this export format what you need?"
- [ ] "How often do you handle applications like this?"

### Feedback Collection Points
- [ ] After each major feature demonstration
- [ ] When showing exports (most important for workflow)
- [ ] During edit mode (validates manual control)
- [ ] At the end for overall impression

### Signs of Positive Reception
- [ ] Participants asking "How do I get this?"
- [ ] Questions about training/implementation
- [ ] Comparing to their current manual process
- [ ] Discussing specific use cases

### Warning Signs to Address
- [ ] Concerns about AI accuracy ‚Üí Emphasize edit mode
- [ ] Technology fears ‚Üí Stress simplicity, no coding needed
- [ ] Job security concerns ‚Üí Emphasize time savings, not replacement
- [ ] Data security questions ‚Üí Explain local processing

## üö® Troubleshooting & Backup Plans

### Common Technical Issues
- [ ] **Server won't start**
  - Backup: Use port 8080 instead
  - Backup: Have screenshots of working system

- [ ] **API key doesn't work**
  - Backup: Have 2-3 different valid keys ready
  - Backup: Use pre-exported results to show functionality

- [ ] **PDF won't upload**
  - Backup: Have different file formats ready (.csv, .xlsx)
  - Backup: Use sample data that works

- [ ] **Browser issues**
  - Primary: Chrome
  - Backup: Microsoft Edge
  - Last resort: Use different computer

### Demo Backup Materials
- [ ] Screenshots of successful analysis results
- [ ] Pre-exported Excel/CSV/PDF files
- [ ] UAT test results printout (92.50% pass rate)
- [ ] Video recording of working demo (if possible)

### Presentation Backup Plan
If live demo fails completely:
- [ ] Use screenshots to walk through workflow
- [ ] Show pre-exported files as examples
- [ ] Focus on gathering requirements and feedback
- [ ] Schedule follow-up technical demo

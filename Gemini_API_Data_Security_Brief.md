## ❓ Common Concerns & Responses

### 🤔 "Will Google use our student data to train their AI?"
**Answer**: No. Google's 2025 policy explicitly states that data from API users is NOT used to train their models. This is different from free consumer services.

### 🤔 "What if there's a data breach?"
**Answer**: Google maintains enterprise-grade security with multiple certifications. Additionally, since we process data locally, there's no central database to breach.

### 🤔 "Can Google employees see our student information?"
**Answer**: Google disconnects data from accounts/API keys before any human review. Staff data is anonymized and not linked back to HKIT.

### 🤔 "How long is our data kept?"
**Answer**: Processing data is kept for 55 days maximum for safety monitoring, then automatically deleted. No permanent storage.

### 🤔 "What about GDPR/privacy laws?"
**Answer**: Google complies with international privacy laws including GDPR. Our local processing approach further minimizes exposure.

### 🤔 "Can we use this without internet?"
**Answer**: The analysis requires internet for AI processing, but all file handling and results management work offline.

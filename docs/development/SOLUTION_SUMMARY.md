- **Export Functions**: Easy access to data export functionality

## User Experience Improvements

### Before the Fix:
- ‚ùå Users had no idea when data was being saved
- ‚ùå No feedback about potentially inaccurate results
- ‚ùå Data management UI might not appear (text-dependent)
- ‚ùå No way to monitor learning system activity
- ‚ùå Had to use browser DevTools to see stored data

### After the Fix:
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Notifications**: Users see exactly when data is saved
- ‚úÖ **Hallucination Warnings**: Clear alerts when results may be inaccurate
- ‚úÖ **Reliable UI**: Data management section always appears correctly
- ‚úÖ **Activity Monitoring**: Optional debug panel shows all operations
- ‚úÖ **User-friendly Data Access**: View stored patterns without technical tools
- ‚úÖ **Progress Feedback**: Clear success/error messages for all operations

## Technical Implementation

### New Files Created:
1. **`notificationManager.js`** - Toast notification system
2. **`debugMonitor.js`** - Advanced monitoring panel

### Files Modified:
1. **`enhanced.html`** - Added notification container and debug UI
2. **`dataManager.js`** - Fixed UI placement using ID instead of text search
3. **`results-display.js`** - Added notifications for storage operations
4. **`editModeController.js`** - Added feedback for user corrections
5. **`storageManager.js`** - Added debug logging for all operations
6. **`gemini-api.js`** - Enhanced validation with user-visible warnings

### Key Features:

- **Comprehensive**: Covers all storage operations
- **Configurable**: Debug panel can be shown/hidden as needed
- **Performance**: Lightweight and doesn't impact analysis speed

## User Guide

### For Regular Users:
1. **Notifications appear automatically** when the system saves data
2. **Warning notifications** alert you to potentially inaccurate subject mappings
3. **Success notifications** confirm when your edits are saved to improve future analysis

### For Advanced Users:
1. **Access Debug Monitor**: Go to Settings ‚Üí Data Management ‚Üí click "Debug Monitor"
2. **View Real-time Activity**: See all storage operations in the Activity Log tab
3. **Check Database Stats**: View current data counts and recent activity
4. **Browse Stored Data**: Preview learning patterns without DevTools

## Impact on Original Problems:

### Problem 1 - Hallucination Detection:
- **Before**: Users only saw inaccurate results in the dropdown
- **After**: Users get immediate warnings about potentially inaccurate subjects and can correct them

### Problem 2 - Storage Visibility:
- **Before**: Users had no idea the learning system was working
- **After**: Users see real-time feedback and can monitor all storage activity

The system now provides complete transparency while maintaining ease of use for all user types.
